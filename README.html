<h1 id="style-prototype">Style Prototype</h1>
<p>A style prototype is a single HTML page which outlines site colors, typography, photographic style, button styles, rollovers, and other necessary elements to establish design direction. In a sense, it is a safety measure intended to avoid rehashing (or completely scrapping) site designs in which hours of time and budget have been invested.</p>
<p>Samantha Warren introduced us to the great idea of presenting designed web elements to clients before creating full site comps. She refers to her Photoshop-based creations as <a href="http://styletil.es">Style Tiles</a>, and they contain most of the same elements that a Style Prototype typically would. However, a Style Prototype takes things one step further into the medium of the web. Rather than present the client a JPG of your Photoshop document, show them a responsive HTML/CSS Style Prototype instead.</p>
